# Doomguy Must Die!
This interdimensional invasion's gettin' cuhrayzee! LET'S ROCK!

Doomguy Must Die is a monster mod built around 3 basic principles:

1. Everything's telegraphed and dodgeable.
2. If you don't dodge, it's gonna hurt (consistently!).
3. This applies to EVERYTHING.

No damage randomization. No chip damage. No bullshit. Bring your A game, because the demons have a new rallying cry: DOOMGUY MUST DIE!
