class Skully : DMDMonster replaces LostSoul {
    // A floating nuisance.
    // 1. Instead of charging directly at you, it likes to charge to either side, periodically spitting projectiles out at 90 degree offsets. Each of these projectiles does 25 damage.
    // 2. When seriously injured, it starts charging directly at you, doing 20 damage on impact. This is less dangerous than the risk of accidentally rocketing yourself in the face.
