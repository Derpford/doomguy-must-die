class Summoner : DMDMonster replaces ArchVile {
    // A terrifying and dangerous adversary.
    // 1. It periodically leaves behind hidden summoning spots. Each summon spot can be consumed to summon a minor enemy from the following list:
    // Grunt, Shotgunner, FlameImp, MadCyberzerker
    // 2. If there are at least five summon spots in play, it can summon a larger enemy:
    // Porkchop, Foofighter, Terminator
    // 3. If it can't summon, it fires a ground-hugging fire wall at you, doing 64 splash damage when it hits something.
