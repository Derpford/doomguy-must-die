class Terminator : DMDMonster replaces Arachnotron {
    // A powerful biomechanical war machine, designed specifically to ruin your day.
    // 1. It can launch a Plasma Star, which fires 10 plasma bolts before dissipating. Each bolt does 40 damage.
    // 2. It also carries a powerful Microwave Beam Cannon, which superheats the ground to cause massive explosions. It takes a second or two for the explosions to go off, but in total, 5 chunks of ground will blow up for 128 in a 128 radius.
    // 3. Finally, the belt-fed machine gun built into the same housing as the MBC allows the Terminator to attack directly, even when the Plasma Star and MBC are on cooldown.
