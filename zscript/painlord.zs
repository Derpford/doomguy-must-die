    // God, I hate these guys.
    // 1. They occasionally summon a pair of Skullies, which immediately begin spamming projectiles. However, this ability has a limited number of charges.
    // 2. Once they're out of Skullies, they'll start spitting slow, lazy, shootable fireballs. These fireballs explode for 128 damage on impact, on being destroyed, or after a few seconds of floating.
