class SoulBorg : DMDMonster replaces ChaingunGuy {
    // A cybernetic freak powered by magitek.
    // 1. His primary attack fires a spread of four souls, which follow a parabolic arc toward their target. Each one does 24 damage.
    // 2. He can also summon a Pain Totem. Enemy attacks that hit the Pain Totem cause it to fire soul blasts at its owner's target. Damage from a player is fired toward the soul totem's owner instead!
