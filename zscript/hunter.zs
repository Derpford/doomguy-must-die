class HunterKiller : DMDMonster replaces Revenant {
    // Missile alert!
    // 1. Fires a series of 4 homing missiles. The missiles are pretty slow...until they get within 256 units of you, at which point they stop tracking and accelerate.
    // Each one does 50 damage on impact. 
    // 2. Sets off a fusilade of teleported explosives, marking a spot somewhere near you. A second or two later, that spot blows the fuck up. 80 splash damage in a 160-unit radius.
